GSM921626	luciferase control knockdown, biological rep1	GSM921626	Public on Feb 13 2014	Apr 24 2012	Feb 14 2014	RNA	1	HeLa	Homo sapiens	cell line: HeLa	treatment: luciferase control knockdown	transient siRNA transfection, plus cycloheximide treatment	HeLa cell culture under standard conditions	total RNA	One day before transfection, HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (1.5 x 10e5 cells per well) or 10-cm culture dishes (4.3 x 10e5 cells per dish). siRNA duplex (at a final concentration in culture medium of 30 nM) was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA duplices were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Four days after siRNA transfection, total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy kit (QIAGEN).	biotin	Ribosomal RNA was depleted from 1µg of total RNA using the RiboMinus Human/Mouse Transcriptome Isolation kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was generated using the GeneChip WT cDNA Synthesis and Amplification Kit (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) per manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was fragmented and end labeled using the GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Inc.).	9606	Approximately 5.5ug of labeled DNA target was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array at 45oC for 16 hours per manufacturers recommendation. Hybridized arrays were washed and stained on a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450.
