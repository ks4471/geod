GSM916556	HCT116 control DMSO 4 h	GSM916556	Public on Apr 17 2013	Apr 17 2012	Apr 17 2013	RNA	1	cell line - HCT116	Homo sapiens	time point: 4 h	cell line: HCT116	cell type: colon carcinoma cells	agent: DMSO	HCT116 cells were treated with CPT (10 uM) for 1, 2, 4, 15 and 20 hours. Controls samples were analyzed at 4 and 20 h following DMSO treatment (0.1%; the solvent used to dissolve CPT). MCF7 cells were treated with CPT (10 uM) for 4 hours. Controls samples were analyzed at 4 h following DMSO treatment. For Top1 down-regulation, HCT116 cells were transfected with a siRNA duplex (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) against the sequence AAGGACTCCATCAGATACTAT from the Top1 mRNA. A negative control siRNA duplex was obtained from Qiagen (target DNA sequence: AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates, at a density of 150,000 cells per well 16 hours before transfection. For each sample, 500 pmoles of siRNA were mixed with 250 mL Optimem (Invitrogen) (mix A). Five mL lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were mixed with 250 mL Optimem and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature (mix B). After combining mixes A and B, reactions were further incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature before adding the siRNA/lipofectamine complexes in 2 mL culture medium. After 5 hours, the medium was replaced with regular medium and cells were incubated for a further 72 hours.	Human HCT116 and MCF7 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-products, West Sacramento, CA) at 37 degrees Celsius in 95% air and 5% CO2.	total RNA	RNA extraction was performed with the “Nucleospin RNA II” kit (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA).	biotin	The array work was done by a core facility according to the Affymetrix standard protocol for exon arrays.	9606	The array work was done by a core facility according to the Affymetrix standard protocol for exon arrays.

After combining mixes A and B, reactions were further incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature before adding the siRNA/lipofectamine complexes in 2 mL culture medium. After 5 hours, the medium was replaced with regular medium and cells were incubated for a further 72 hours.	Human HCT116 and MCF7 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-products, West Sacramento, CA) at 37 degrees Celsius in 95% air and 5% CO2.	total RNA	RNA extraction was performed with the “Nucleospin RNA II” kit (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA).	biotin	The array work was done by a core facility according to the Affymetrix standard protocol for exon arrays.	9606	The array work was done by a core facility according to the Affymetrix standard protocol for exon arrays.

GSM1070783	HCT116 Top1 siRNA - experiment 1	GSM1070783	Public on Apr 17 2013	Jan 25 2013	Apr 17 2013	RNA	1	cell line - HCT116	Homo sapiens	cell line: HCT116	cell type: colon carcinoma cells	transfection: with a Top1 siRNA		HCT116 cells were treated with CPT (10 uM) for 1, 2, 4, 15 and 20 hours. Controls samples were analyzed at 4 and 20 h following DMSO treatment (0.1%; the solvent used to dissolve CPT). MCF7 cells were treated with CPT (10 uM) for 4 hours. Controls samples were analyzed at 4 h following DMSO treatment. For Top1 down-regulation, HCT116 cells were transfected with a siRNA duplex (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) against the sequence AAGGACTCCATCAGATACTAT from the Top1 mRNA. A negative control siRNA duplex was obtained from Qiagen (target DNA sequence: AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT).
