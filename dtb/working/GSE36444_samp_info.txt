AGS cells were treated with 100 nM LBH589 for 24h.	total RNA	Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen according to manufactures instructions	biotin	One-Cycle cRNA labeling kit from Affymetrix	9606	Hybridization to the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array according to Affymetrix protocol.	According to Affymetrix protocol	Our core facility did the data processing according to standardized methods of affymetrix. (The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.)
