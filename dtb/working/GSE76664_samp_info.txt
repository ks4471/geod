Quality control was performed with Agilent Bioanalyzer.	biotin	A total of 500ng of total RNA was prepared for hybridization to the Ilumina humanHT 12 Expression Beadchip by preparing a probe cocktail (cRNA @ 0.05ug/ul) that includes GEX-HYB Hybridization Buffer (supplied with the beadchip).	9606	A total hybridization volume of 15ul was prepared for each sample and 15ul loaded into a single array on the Ilumina humanHT 12 Expression Beadchip. A total of 12 different labelled samples can be loaded into 12 individual arrays per beadchip.  The chip was then hybridized at 58C for 16 hours in an oven with a rocking platform.  After hybridization, the chip was washed using the appropriate protocols as outlined in the Illumina manual.  Upon completion of the washing, the chips were then coupled with Cy3 and scanned in the Illumina iScan Reader.
