Arrays were washed and stained with phycoerythrin with Fluidics Station 450 and scanned using the Gene-Chip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions	The quality control (QC) matrices were confirmed with expression console software (Affymertix, USA) and Partek genomics suite version 6.6 (Partek Inc.St.Louis,USA). QC passed CEL files were further analyzed using Partek genomics suite version 6.6. All CEL files were RMA background corrected, quantile normalized and all probe sets were summarized using median polish algorithm.
