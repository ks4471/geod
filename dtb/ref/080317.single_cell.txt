In human hematopoiesis, megakaryocytes and erythroid cells differentiate from a shared precursor, the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP), which remains poorly defined.Results: To clarify the cellular pathway in erythro-megakaryocyte differentiation, we correlated the surface immunophenotype, transcriptional profile and differentiation potential of individual MEP cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Conventional 2-D differentiation from pluripotency fails to recapitulate cell interactions occurring during organogenesis. 3-D organoids generate complex organ-like tissues, however it is unclear how heterotypic interactions impact lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency in 2-D culture. We then derive 3-D liver bud (LB) organoids by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct heterogeneity during LB self-organization. more...

68. Deconstructing the dynamic transcriptional program of pluripotent stem cells.
(Submitter supplied) Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of dynamic interconversion between distinct substates, but the regulatory circuits specifying these states and enabling transitions between them are not well understood. We set out to address this issue and map the landscape of gene expression variability in PSCs by single-cell expression profiling of PSCs under different chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that signaling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression in PSCs, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signaling pathways and chromatin regulators. Strikingly, either removal of mature miRNAs or pharmacologic blockage of external signaling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency regulatory network, increased self-renewal efficiency, and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by the action of opposing miRNA families on the c-myc / Lin28 / let-7 axis. These findings illuminate the causes of transcriptional heterogeneity in PSCs and their consequences for cellular decision-making.

70. Loss of CSL unlocks a hypoxic response and enhanced tumor growth potential in breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Notch signaling is an important regulator of stem cell differentiation. All canonical Notch signaling is transmitted through the DNA-binding protein CSL and hyperactivated Notch signaling is associated with tumor development; thus it may be anticipated that CSL deficiency should reduce tumor growth. In contrast, we report that genetic removal of CSL in breast tumor cells caused accelerated growth of xenografted tumors. more...

80. Inference of cell-type composition from human brain transcriptomic datasets illuminates the effects of age, manner of death, dissection, and psychiatric diagnosis
(Submitter supplied) Most neuroscientists would agree that psychiatric illness is unlikely to arise from pathological changes that occur uniformly across all cells in a given brain region. Despite this fact, the majority of transcriptomic analyses of the human brain to date are conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of conducting single-cell level analyses on donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary brain cell types identified in published single cell type transcriptomic experiments. more...

84. Dynamic Changes in the Copy Number of Pluripotency and Cell Proliferation Genes in Human ES and iPS Cells during Reprogramming and Time in Culture
(Submitter supplied) Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and iPSCs) are being considered as sources of differentiated cells for drug development and cell therapy. Genomic stability of these cells is important for in vitro studies, and is critical for clinical applications.  Of particular concern for cell therapy is the known association between genetic aberrations and tumorigenicity.  Our results highlight the dynamic nature of genomic abnormalities in pluripotent stem cell culture and the need for frequent genomic monitoring of pluripotent stem cells destined for transplantation in order to determine the impact of specific genomic changes on phenotypic stability and clinical safety.

Hence innovative approaches to engineer HSC are critically needed. HoxB4 over-expression in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived HSC (ESC-HSC) confers long-term engraftment, yet lacks efficient lymphogenesis.

(Submitter supplied) We explore the heterogeneity of mouse thoracic ganglia demonstrating the presence of an unexpected variety of cell-types and identify specialized populations of nipple- and pilo-erector muscle neurons. These neurons extend axonal projections and are born amongst other neurons during embryogenesis, but remain unspecialized until target organogenesis occurs postnatally. Target innervation and cell-type specification is coordinated by an intricate acquisition of unique combinations of growth factor receptors and the initiation of expression of concomitant ligands by the nascent erector muscles.

(Submitter supplied) Despite major advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer, metastasis remains the cause of >90% of cancer-related mortality1. Understanding metastasis initiation and progression is critical to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent metastatic disease. Prevailing theories hypothesize that metastases are seeded by rare tumor cells with unique properties, which may function like stem cells in their ability to initiate and propagate metastatic tumors.2 3-5 However, the identity of metastasis-initiating cells in human breast cancer remains elusive, and whether metastases are hierarchically organized is unknown.2 Here we show at the single-cell level that early stage metastatic cells possess a distinct stem-like gene expression signature. more...

138. Stereo-sequencing: 3D Transcriptome of the mouse embryo at gastrulation
(Submitter supplied) To glean an appreciation of the holistic genetic activity in the gastrulating mouse embryo, we performed a genome-wide spatial transcriptome analysis (Stereo-seq), using a low-cell number sequencing protocol on laser microdissected samples of epiblast cells with retained positional address. The 3D transcriptome reveals that (i) the epiblast is partitioned into transcription domains corresponding to regions of epiblast where cells are endowed specifically with ectoderm and mesendoderm potency, (ii) novel lineage markers are identified as genes expressed in epiblast domains populated by cells displaying different lineage fates, (iii) functionally related gene regulatory circuitry and signaling pathways are acting in concert in the transcriptional domains, and (iv) the spatial information provides reference zipcodes for mapping the prospective address of cell samples from different embryos and stem cell lines. more...

139. Zygotes segregate entire parental genomes in distinct blastomere lineages causing cleavage stage chimaerism and mixolpoidy
(Submitter supplied) Chimaerism and mixoploidy define the presence of cell lineages with different parental genomes or different ploidy states in a single individual. Our knowledge on their mechanistic origin results from indirect observations, often when the cell lineages have been subject to rigorous selective pressure during development. Here, we applied haplarithmisis to infer the haplotypes and the copy number of parental genomes in 116 single blastomeres comprising entire preimplantation stage bovine embryos (n=23) following in vitro fertilization. more...

146. Induction of pluripotency in human somatic cells via a primitive streak-like state
(Submitter supplied) During mammalian embryonic development, the primitive streak is initiates the differentiation of pluripotent epiblast cells into germ layers. Pluripotency can be reacquired in committed somatic cells using a combination of handful transcription factors, such as OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (hereafter referred to as OSKM), albeit with low efficiency . Here we   show that, during the OSKM-induced reprogramming process toward pluripotency in human cells, intermediate cells transiently show gene expression profiles resembling mesendoderm, which is a major component of the primitive streak. more...

147. Converting adult pancreatic α-cells into β-cells by targeting Dnmt1 and Arx
(Submitter supplied) After their destruction in adult mice, insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells slowly regenerate from other islet cells, like glucagon-producing alpha-cells. However the molecular basis of this conversion is unknown. Moreover it remains unclear if this intra-islet cell conversion is relevant to human diseases with extensive beta-cell loss, like in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we show that subsets of glucagon-expressing cells in subjects with T1D produce Insulin and other molecular features of beta-cells, accompanied by loss of the alpha-cell regulators DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx). more...

(Submitter supplied) Methods for haplotyping and DNA copy number typing of single cells are paramount for studying genomic heterogeneity and enabling genetic diagnosis. Before analyzing the DNA of a single cell by microarray or next-generation sequencing, a whole-genome amplification (WGA) process is required that substantially distorts the frequency and composition of the cell’s alleles. As a consequence, haplotyping methods suffer from error-prone discrete SNP-genotypes (AA, AB, BB), and DNA copy number profiling remains difficult as true DNA copy number aberrations have to be discriminated from WGA-artifacts. more...

170. Single Cell Sequencing Identifies Key Epigenetic Regulators in Nuclear Transfer Mediated Reprogramming [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Differentiated cell can be reprogrammed into totipotent embryo through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, this process is highly inefficient and most cloned embryos arrest at certain developmental stages. Through single cell sequencing combined with embryo biopsy, here we generate a global map of DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome for SCNT embryos with distinct developmental fates. We subsequently demonstrate that the unfaithful reactivation of two histone demethylases, Kdm4b and Kdm5b, accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at 2-cell and 4-cell stage, respectively. more...

171. Sexual cell fate reprogramming in the ovary by DMRT1
(Submitter supplied) Transcription factors related to the insect sex determination gene Doublesex (DMRT proteins) control sex determination and/or sexual differentiation in diverse metazoans. They also are implicated in transitions between sex-determining mechanisms during vertebrate evolution. In mice Dmrt1 is required for male gonadal differentiation in somatic cells and germ cells. DMRT1 also maintains male gonadal sex: its loss, even in adults, can trigger sexual fate reprogramming in which male Sertoli cells transdifferentiate into their female equivalents - granulosa cells - and testicular tissue reorganizes to a more ovarian morphology. more...

204. Non-clonal mosaicism in human somatic and embryonic stem cells revealed by single-cell array-based copy-number variation analysis
(Submitter supplied) Although it is known that cultured human cells acquire copy number variations over time, little is known about the mutation frequency in individual cells. Here we describe that human somatic and embryonic stem cell cultures show significant fractions of cells carrying unique chromosomal abnormalities, forming a non-clonal genetic mosaic. We studied 85 human single cells by array-based comparative genomic hybridisation and found that 14-31% of hESC and 8-26% of somatic cells are chromosomally abnormal. more...

206. Microfluidic single-cell whole-transcriptome sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying gene expression heterogeneity in populations of cells. Many techniques have, thus, been recently developed to perform transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on individual cells. To probe subtle biological variation between samples with limiting amounts of RNA, more precise and sensitive methods are still required. We adapted a previously developed strategy for single-cell RNA-Seq that has shown promise for superior sensitivity and implemented the chemistry in a microfluidic platform for single-cell whole transcriptome analysis. more...

In CN-AML with poorer prognosis, mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) commonly co-occur (1-3). We demonstrate that mice with Flt3-internal-tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) and inducible deletion of Dnmt3a spontaneously develop a rapidly-lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML of normal karyotype. more...

(Submitter supplied) The Saccharomyces cerevisae RAD3 gene is homolog of human XPD, an essential gene encoding a DNA helicase of the TFIIH complex involved in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Mutant alleles of RAD3 have been identified (rad3-101 and rad3-102) that have partial defects in DNA repair associated with a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies showed that the hyper-Rec phenotype associated with rad3-101 and rad3-102 can be explained as a consequence of persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. more...

223. Molecular signatures of heterogeneous stem cell populations are resolved by linking single cell functional assays to single cell gene expression
(Submitter supplied) The discovery of significant heterogeneity in the self-renewal durability of adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has challenged our understanding of the molecules involved in population maintenance throughout life.  Gene expression studies in bulk populations are difficult to interpret since multiple HSC subtypes are present and HSC purity is typically less than 50% of the input cell population.  Numerous groups have therefore turned to studying gene expression profiles of single HSCs, but again these studies are limited by the purity of the input fraction and an inability to directly ascribe a molecular program to a durable self-renewing HSC.  Here we combine single cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single cell gene expression assays to gain the first insight into the gene expression program of HSCs that possess durable self-renewal.  This approach can be used in other stem cell systems and sets the stage for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions.

Among the various conditions that should be optimized, the precise role and contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during differentiation are relatively unclear. Here, using a short fragment of laminin 411 (LM411-E8), an ECM predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelial basement membrane, we demonstrated that the directed switching of defined ECMs robustly yields highly purified (>95%) endothelial progenitor cells (PSC-EPCs) from hPSCs in integrin-laminin axis and rho signaling pathway-dependent manner.

However, comparison of two unique methods of aneuploidy screening of blastomeres within the same embryo has not been conducted and may indicate whether mosaicism is overestimated due to technical inconsistency rather than biological phenomena.  The present study investigates the prevalence of chromosomal abnormality and mosaicism found with two different single cell aneuploidy screening techniques.Thirteen arrested cleavage stage embryos were studied. more...

To assure segregation of intact chromosomes, cell division is presumed to be under strict control of cell-cycle checkpoints. Estimates of chromosomal mutation rates per generation based on cytogenetic analyses of newborns and products of conception, range between 4.57x10-5 and 3.42x10-4. In contrast, the high incidence of segmental imbalances detected by single-cell genome-wide copy number profiling indicates that the error rate per cell division might be more than an order of magnitude higher. more...

264. Collier/OLF/EBF-dependent transcriptional dynamics control muscle specification from cardiopharyngeal progenitors
(Submitter supplied) In vertebrates, pluripotent pharyngeal mesoderm progenitors produce the cardiac precursors of the second heart field as well as the branchiomeric head muscles and associated stem cells. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from multipotent progenitors to distinct heart and muscle precursors remain obscured by the complexity of vertebrate embryos. Here, using the ascidian Ciona intestinalis as a simple chordate model for cardiopharyngeal development, we show that bipotent progenitors are transcriptionally primed to activate both heart and pharyngeal muscle regulatory programs, which become restricted to the corresponding precursors following a conserved pattern of asymmetric divisions. more...

(Submitter supplied) An enduring issue in evolutionary and cancer biology is how replication infidelity influences genome composition and vice versa. Here we examine this issue by sequencing the genomes of diploid budding yeast strains that are either mismatch repair (MMR) proficient or deficient and encode wild type or mutator variants of the three major nuclear DNA replicases. Analysis of over 43,000 mutations that accumulated in the absence of selective pressure demonstrates that the nuclear DNA replication machinery generates less than one mismatch per genome and in combination with MMR, achieves a genome-wide per base error rate of 1.7 x 10-10. more...

277. Properties of mammalian neural progenitor cells as revealed by genome-wide single cell gene expression profiles
(Submitter supplied) Cellular diversity of the brain is largely attributed to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of progenitor cells. In mammalian cerebral development, it has been difficult to determine how neural progenitor cells are heterogeneous, due to their dynamic changes in nuclear position and gene expression. To address this issue, we systematically analyzed the cDNA profiles of a large number of single progenitor cells at the mid-embryonic stage. more...

285. Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis (PAGODA)
(Submitter supplied) The extent of transcriptional diversity in mouse NPCs is likely to be influenced by a variety of unexamined factors that include programmed cell death, genomic mosaicism as well as a variety of “environmental” influences such as changes in exposure to signaling lipids. We therefore used scRNA-seq to assess a cohort of cortical NPCs from an embryonic mouse. We demonstrate that PAGODA (Pathway And Geneset OverDispersion Analysis) effectively recovers the known neuroanatomical and functional organization of NPCs, identifying multiple aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity within the developing mouse cortex that are difficult to discern by the existing heterogeneity analysis approaches.

309. RNA-SEQ analysis of single cells extracted from the renal vesicles of P4 Crym-EGFP transgenic mice
(Submitter supplied) We used micro-dissection with FACS sorting techniques to isolate renal vesicle single cell types from post natal day (P4) kidneys. A subset of these single cell populations is analysed individually via Fluidigm single cell analysis. This analysis will determine the transcriptional profile of each cell type, identify compartment specific transcripts, compartment specific transcript isoforms and cell-type specific long-noncoding RNAs. more...

310. A Global Transcriptome Analysis of BMSC Senescence
(Submitter supplied) Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be expanded by serial passage, but expansion is limited by cell senescence.  The nature of changes associated with BMSC serial passages was assessed. Transcriptome analysis of 10 early and 15 late passage samples from 5 subjects revealed 2193 differentially expressed genes; those highly expressed in early passage cells were overrepresented in skeletal system development, embryonic morphogenesis, tube morphogenesis, etc, while those highly expressed in the late passage BMSCs were overrepresented in nucleosome assembly; chromatin assembly, DNA packaging, etc. more...

311. Dynamics of gene expression changes in epithelial and mesenchymal HMLER cell lines transitioning from suspension 3D culture to adhesion cultures
(Submitter supplied) In order to metastasize, few cells need to detach from the primary tumor, and transition through the circulation to distant sites to establish new solid tumor metastases. The gene expression changes occurring between these transitions are poorly understood, and controversial findings have been reported regarding transitions between epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) cell states. To model the metastasis process in vitro, here we examined the dynamics of gene expression changes and respective cell fates that are occurring in cells that are transitioning from adhesion culture to suspension 3D culture (mammospheres) and back to adhesion culture in vitro. more...

(Submitter supplied) We report a single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing method (scBS-Seq) capable of accurately measuring DNA methylation at up to 36% of CpGs. We observed that ESCs grown in serum/LIF or 2i/LIF both display epigenetic heterogeneity, with “2i-like” cells present in serum cultures. In silico integration of 12 individual MII oocytes datasets  recapitulates the whole DNA methylome, making scBS-Seq a versatile tool to explore DNA methylation in rare cells and heterogeneous populations.

314. Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Technique Impacts the Accuracy of SNP Microarray Based Genotyping and Copy Number Analyses
(Submitter supplied) Methods of comprehensive microarray based analyses of single cell DNA are rapidly emerging.  Whole genome amplification (WGA) remains a critical component for these methods to be successful.  A number of commercially available WGA kits have been independently utilized in previous single cell microarray studies.  However, direct comparison of their performance on single cells has not been conducted.  The present study demonstrates that among previously published methods, a single cell GenomePlex WGA protocol provides the best combination of speed and accuracy for SNP microarray based copy number analysis when compared to a REPLI-g or GenomiPhi based protocol.  Alternatively, for applications that do not have constraints on turn-around time and that are directed at accurate genotyping rather than copy number assignments, a REPLI-g based protocol may provide the best solution.

All methods introduced amplification-dependent noise when mRNA was amplified 108-fold, compared with data from unamplified cDNA. PCR-amplified cDNA demonstrated the smallest number of differences between two parallel replicate samples and the best correlation between independent amplifications from the same cell type, with SMART outperforming global PCR amplification. more...

(Submitter supplied) We provide direct in vivo evidence for activation of the BCR and canonical NF-KB pathways in MCL that, in the absence of activating mutations, is dependent on the lymph node microenvironment. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the surprising efficacy of ibrutinib for the treatment of this type of lymphoma. Mutations in components of the BCR and NF-KB pathways are associated with cell-autonomous signaling and resistance to ibrutinib.

(Submitter supplied) Preservation of chromosome integrity is key for the survival of any organism. To assure segregation of intact chromosomes, cell division is presumed to be under strict control of cell-cycle checkpoints. Estimates of chromosomal mutation rates per generation based on cytogenetic analyses of newborns and products of conception, range between 4.57x10-5 and 3.42x10-4. In contrast, the high incidence of segmental imbalances detected by single-cell genome-wide copy number profiling indicates that the error rate per cell division might be more than an order of magnitude higher. more...

326. Tbx3 controls Dppa3 levels to regulate exit from pluripotency towards mesodermal lineage
(Submitter supplied) Tbx3, a member of the T-box family, plays important roles in development, stem cells, nuclear reprogramming and cancer. Loss of Tbx3 induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, we show that mESCs exist in an alternate stable pluripotent state in the absence of Tbx3. In-depth transcriptome analysis of this mESC state reveals Dppa3 as a direct downstream target of Tbx3. Also Tbx3 facilitates the cell fate transition from pluripotent cells to mesoderm progenitors by directly repressing Wnt pathway members required for differentiation. more...

343. Proliferating Langerhans cells dampen inflammation in established mouse psoriatic lesions
(Submitter supplied) Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology. Although macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) have been proposed to drive the psoriatic cascade, their largely overlapping phenotype hampered studying their respective role. Topical application of Imiquimod, a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, induces psoriasis in patients and psoriasiform inflammation in mice. We showed that daily application of Imiquimod for 14 days recapitulated both the initiation and the maintenance phase of psoriasis. more...

344. Dynamic and static maintenance of epigenetic memory in pluripotent and somatic cells [human]
(Submitter supplied) Stable maintenance of gene regulatory programs is essential for normal function in multi-cellular organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms, and DNA methylation in particular, are hypothesized to facilitate such maintenance by creating cellular memory that can be written during embryonic development and then guide cell-type specific gene expression. Here we use new methods to study distributions of DNA methylation patterns within cell populations to show that embryonic stem cells preserve their epigenetic state by balancing antagonistic processes that add and remove methylation marks rather than by copying epigenetic information from mother to daughter cells. more...

345. Dynamic genome-wide transcriptional response of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells to IL-6 and Il-10
(Submitter supplied) Single cell timecourse experiments demonstrated that though IL-6 and IL-10 activate STAT3, they generate different temporal patterns of activation, with IL-6 generating a transient activation of STAT3, and IL-10 generating a sustained STAT3 response. We hypothesized that these different STAT3 activation dynamics would dictate the differing cellular responses to the two cytokines.

(Submitter supplied) To determine early changes leading to human cell transformation (cancer) we exposed an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, to one of four different metals that may cause cancer via inhalation in humans or rodents: 2.0 micro-Molar soluble sodium arsenite (NaAsO2), 0.50 micro-Molar potassium chromate (K2CrO4), 250 micro-Molar nickel (II) sulfate (NiSO4), 10 micro-Molar sodium meta-vanadate (NaVO3), or were left untreated (control). more...

381. Convergence of TCR and IL-7 pathways leads to FOXO3a phosphorylation and drives the survival of C. Memory CD4+ T cells
(Submitter supplied) The molecular events that are involved in the establishment and the maintenance of CD4+ Central Memory (TCM) and Effector Memory (TEM) T cells are poorly understood. Using global gene expression profiling, single cell proteomics, and functional assays, we show that the survival of TCM CD4+ T cells involves the activation and phosphorylation of STAT5a and FOXO3a. STAT5a phosphorylation induces the transcriptional up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes specifically in TCM. more...

385. Segmental chromosomal imbalances arise at high frequency in human fibroblasts (SB_sc_1)
(Submitter supplied) Preservation of chromosome integrity is key for the survival of any organism. To assure segregation of intact chromosomes, cell division is presumed to be under strict control of cell-cycle checkpoints. Estimates of chromosomal mutation rates per generation based on cytogenetic analyses of newborns and products of conception, range between 4.57x10-5 and 3.42x10-4. In contrast, the high incidence of segmental imbalances detected by single-cell genome-wide copy number profiling indicates that the error rate per cell division might be more than an order of magnitude higher. more...

388. Transcriptional identity and function of human dendritic cells is dictated by origin not tissue microenvironment
(Submitter supplied) It has been well established that murine myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) derive from a separate hematopoietic precursor before they migrate via the blood stream to peripheral tissues. Moreover, two classes of murine conventional DCs (cDC1 and cDC2 DCs) and one class of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were shown to be transcriptionally and functionally distinct entities. In humans, these DC subtypes have also been identified based on the cell surface markers CD1c (cDC2), CD141 (cDC1), and CD303 (pDCs), albeit it still remains elusive whether DC functionality is mainly determined by ontogeny or the tissue microenvironment. more...

Here, we demonstrate that reprogramming can be achieved within a few hours and a single cell-cycle as long as two key constraints on reprogramming are satisfied.  First, the recipient cell chromosomes must be removed during mitosis. more...

One promising approach is transdifferentiation of developmentally related pancreatic cell types including glucagon-producing alpha cells. In a genetic model, overexpression of the master regulatory transcription factor Pax4 or loss of its counterplayer Arx are sufficient to induce the conversion of alpha cells to functional beta-like cells. more...

392. Single Cell Sequencing Identifies Key Epigenetic Regulators in Nuclear Transfer Mediated Reprogramming [RRBS]
(Submitter supplied) Differentiated cell can be reprogrammed into totipotent embryo through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, this process is highly inefficient and most cloned embryos arrest at certain developmental stages. Through single cell sequencing combined with embryo biopsy, here we generate a global map of DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome for SCNT embryos with distinct developmental fates. We subsequently demonstrate that the unfaithful reactivation of two histone demethylases, Kdm4b and Kdm5b, accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at 2-cell and 4-cell stage, respectively. more...

We report a method to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of ~400 maps reveals a core architecture of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts are more sensitive to a change in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. more...

(Submitter supplied) Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating sub-populations of cells are based on mRNA or protein expression of only few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumor cells is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. more...

410. Reinforced STAT3 activity sustains self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells in a naive-like state
(Submitter supplied) Only rodent embryonic stem (ES) cells can self-renew in the pristine state of pluripotency called the naive or ground state. Human ES (hES) cells self-renew in the so-called primed state of pluripotency, which is an obstacle to research, hindering cost-effective cultivation in media devoid of animal-derived products, genetic stability, and genome engineering. Here we show that forced expression of a hormone-dependent STAT3-ERT2, in combination with LIF and inhibitors of MEK and GSK3beta, allows hES cells to escape from the primed state, and enter a new state designated as TL2i, characterized by the activation of STAT3 target genes, regular passaging by single cell dissociation, and the expression of naive state-specific transcription factors. more...

411. Do different neurons age differently? Direct genome-wide analysis of aging in single identified cholinergic neurons
(Submitter supplied) The complexity of events associated with age-related memory loss (ARML) cannot be overestimated. The problem is further complicated by the enormous diversity of neurons in the CNS and even synapses of one neuron within a neural circuit. Large-scale single-neuron analysis is not only challenging but mostly impractical for any model currently used in ARML. We simply do not know: do all neurons and synapses age differently or are some neurons (or synapses) more resistant to aging than others? What is happening in any given neuron while it undergoes “normal” aging? What are the genomic changes that make aging apparently irreversible?  What would be the balance between neuron-specific vs global genome-wide changes in aging? In the proposed paper we address these questions and develop a new model to study the entire scope of genomic and epigenomic regulation in aging at the resolution of single functionally characterized cells and even cell compartments. more...

(Submitter supplied) The molecular pathways and microenvironmental cues that choreograph the conversion of endothelial cells (ECs) into true engraftable haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain undefined. This is due to lack of models to recreate the ephemeral transition from endothelial to haemogenic cells and to HSCs. Here, we have developed a novel sequential in vitro model in which by precise conditional sequential on-off expression of transcription factors: FosB, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (FGRS); and re-establishing a proper inductive vascular niche, we were able to reprogram adult mouse ECs into HSCs (rEC-HSCs) over a 28 day period. more...

IgE B-cell differentiation is characterized by a transient GC phase, a bias towards the plasma cell (PC) fate, and dependence on sequential switching for the production of high-affinity IgE. We show here that IgE GC B cells are unfit to undergo the conventional GC differentiation program due to impaired B-cell receptor function and increased apoptosis. more...

Little is known regarding the role the resident glia, the Müller glia, play in the progression of the disease. Here we define gene expression changes in Müller glial cells (MGCs) from two different mouse models of RP, the retinal degeneration 1 (rd1) and rhodopsin knock-out (Rhod-ko) models. more...

(Submitter supplied) Transcriptome profiling is an indispensable tool in advancing the understanding of single cell biology, but depends upon methods capable of isolating mRNA at the spatial resolution of a single cell. Current capture methods lack sufficient spatial resolution to isolate mRNA from individual in vivo resident cells without damaging adjacent tissue. Because of this limitation, it has been difficult to assess the influence of the microenvironment on the transcriptome of individual neurons. more...

455. Defining a molecular roadmap of cellular reprogramming into iPS cells [mRNA profiling]
(Submitter supplied) Factor induced reprogramming is a slow and inefficient process with only rare cells progressing towards induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Owing to these restraints, mechanistic studies have been limited to analyses of heterogeneous bulk populations undergoing reprogramming and partially reprogrammed cell lines. Here, by combining surface markers (Thy1, SSEA1) and an Oct4-GFP fluorescent reporter allele, we analyzed defined intermediate cell populations poised to becoming iPSCs at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels using genome-wide and single cell technologies. more...

(Submitter supplied) The extent of lung regeneration following catastrophic damage and the potential role of adult stem cells in such a process remains obscure.  Sublethal infection of mice with an H1N1 influenza virus related to that of the 1918 pandemic triggers massive airway damage followed by apparent regeneration.  We show here that p63-expressing stem cells in the bronchiolar epithelium undergo rapid proliferation after infection and radiate to interbronchiolar regions of alveolar ablation. more...

(Submitter supplied) CTCF and BORIS (CTCFL), two paralogous mammalian proteins sharing nearly identical DNA binding domains, are thought to function in mutually exclusive manners in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. more...

Hence innovative approaches to engineer HSC are critically needed. HoxB4 over-expression in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived HSC (ESC-HSC) confers long-term engraftment, yet lacks efficient lymphogenesis.

(Submitter supplied) RNA editing is a mutational mechanism that specifically alters the nucleotide content in sets of transcripts while leaving their cognate genomic blueprint intact. Editing has been detected from bulk RNA-seq data in thousands of distinct transcripts, but apparent editing rates can vary widely (from under 1% to almost 100%). These observed editing rates could result from approximately equal rates of editing within each individual cell in the bulk sample, or alternatively, editing estimates from a population of cells could reflect an average of distinct, biologically significant editing signatures that vary substantially between individual cells in the population. more...

(Submitter supplied) Haematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood cell types. In this process, cells become progressively restricted to a single cell type. The order in which differentiating cells loose lineage potential, and the prospective isolation of cells with a defined potential remains a long-standing question.  We performed gene expression analysis of haematopoietic cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mice, leading to a model for hematopoiesis where the initial lineage decision consists of a separation of erythroid/megakaryocyte/mast cell/eosinophil potential from lymphopoietic/monocyte/neutrophil potential

Several studies have reported that iPSC retain an epigenetic memory from the tissue from which they were derived. However, the influence of the method used for reprogramming in the final pluripotent state has not been investigated yet. Therefore, we have taken advantage of germline stem cells (GSCs) that can be converted into germline pluripotent stem cells (gPSCs) using specific culture conditions or into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) after the forced expression of four transcription factors. more...

486. Single cell transcriptomics defines human islet cell signatures and reveals cell-type-specific expression changes in type 2 diabetes [bulk]
(Submitter supplied) Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of at least five cell types constituting pancreatic islets. Changes in the proportion and/or function of these cells are associated with genetic and molecular pathophysiology of monogenic, type 1, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cellular heterogeneity impedes precise understanding of the molecular components of each islet cell type that govern islet dysfunction, particularly the less abundant delta and gamma/pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Sperm are highly differentiated and the activities that reprogram them for embryonic development during fertilization have historically been considered unique to the oocyte. We here challenge this view and demonstrate that mouse embryos in the mitotic cell cycle can also directly reprogram sperm for full term development. Developmentally incompetent haploid embryos (parthenogenotes) injected with sperm developed to produce healthy offspring at up to 24% of control rates, depending when in the embryonic cell cycle injection took place. more...

It is important to understand the fundamental mechanism by which CR extends lifespan that remains elusive. Owing to well-established genomic tools and convenience of culture system, we used a single cell organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to clarify the mechanisms of CR. In order to identify genes responsible for CR-mediated longevity, we performed microarray experiments across the longevity assurance time-points.

Although pluripotent stem cells have been obtained from defined germline stem cells (GSCs) of mouse neonatal testis, only multipotent stem cells have been obtained so far from defined cells of mouse adult testis. In this study we describe a robust and reproducible protocol for obtaining germline-derived pluripotent stem (gPS) cells from adult unipotent GSCs. more...

562. Lineage-specific enhancers activate self-renewal genes in macrophages and embryonic stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Differentiated macrophages can self-renew in tissues and expand long-term in culture, but the gene regulatory mechanisms that accomplish self-renewal in the differentiated state have remained unknown. Here we show that in mice, the transcription factors MafB and c-Maf repress a macrophage-specific enhancer repertoire associated with a gene network controlling self-renewal. Single cell analysis revealed that, in vivo, proliferating resident macrophages can access this network by transient down-regulation of Maf transcription factors. more...

(Submitter supplied) Obtaining highly purified differentiated cells via directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is an essential step for the clinical application of hPSCs. Among the various conditions that should be optimized, the precise role and contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during differentiation are relatively unclear. Here, using a short fragment of laminin 411 (LM411-E8), an ECM predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelial basement membrane, we demonstrated that the directed switching of defined ECMs robustly yields highly purified (>95%) endothelial progenitor cells (PSC-EPCs) from hPSCs in integrin-laminin axis and rho signaling pathway-dependent manner.

582. Gene expression profile analysis of conditional Mll2 knockout germinal center B cells and littermate controls
(Submitter supplied) Somatic mutations of the MLL2 methyltransferase gene represent a common genetic lesion in multiple cancer types. In diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (collectively, over 70% of all lymphoma diagnoses), these mutations are highly recurrent and appear early during transformation, possibly in pre-malignant precursors. Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated MLL2 mutations impair its enzymatic activity and lead to diminished global H3K4 methylation in normal germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL, consistent with the enrichment of MLL2 binding at enhancer and promoter regions marked by mono- and tri-methylation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Methods for haplotyping and DNA copy number typing of single cells are paramount for studying genomic heterogeneity and enabling genetic diagnosis. Before analyzing the DNA of a single cell by microarray or next-generation sequencing, a whole-genome amplification (WGA) process is required that substantially distorts the frequency and composition of the cell’s alleles. As a consequence, haplotyping methods suffer from error-prone discrete SNP-genotypes (AA, AB, BB), and DNA copy number profiling remains difficult as true DNA copy number aberrations have to be discriminated from WGA-artifacts. more...

In lymphatic tissues, CLL cells are interspersed with CD68+ nurselike cells (NLC) and T cells. However, the mechanism regulating co-localization of CLL cells and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross-talk between CLL and NLC, we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after co-culture with NLC. more...

This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the surprising efficacy of ibrutinib for the treatment of this type of lymphoma. Mutations in components of the BCR and NF-KB pathways are associated with cell-autonomous signaling and resistance to ibrutinib.

(Submitter supplied) Pericytes are integral components of the tissue vasculature and have essential functions in tumour angiogenesis. Endosialin (CD248) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed on pericytes in the tumour vasculature of most solid tumours, however it is low or negligibly expressed on normal tissue pericytes. Experiments using wild-type and endosialin-knockout mice has revealed that stromal endosialin expression facilitates intravasation of tumor cells from the primary tumor into the circulation, thereby promoting metastatic dissemination.

629. Expression data from transgenic ERG, GATA1s KI and ERG/GATA1s fetal livers
(Submitter supplied) DS children have a 500-fold increased risk for developing acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). Around 10% of DS newborns have a transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) that resolves spontaneously. Somatic mutations acquired during fetal hematopoiesis in the GATA1 transcription factor are detected in megakaryoblasts from all the DS TMDs or AMKLs. GATA1 is an X chromosome transcription factor essential for the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages. more...

630. High-resolution genome replication profiles, modeling and single-cell imaging define the stochastic nature of replication initiation and termination
(Submitter supplied) Eukaryotic genome replication is stochastic with each cell using a different cohort of replication origins. Interpreting high-resolution genome replication profiles with a mathematical model allowed us to quantify the stochastic nature of genome replication. This approach included estimation of the activity of every replication origin and the genome-wide location of replication termination events. Single-cell measurements verified the inferred values for stochastic origin replication time. more...

631. CSF-1R inhibition alters macrophage polarization and blocks gliomagenesis
(Submitter supplied) Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, can be divided into several molecular subtypes including proneural GBM. Most clinical strategies aimed at directly targeting glioma cells in these tumors have failed. A promising alternative is to target stromal cells in the brain microenvironment, such as tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are dependent upon colony stimulating factor (CSF)-1 for differentiation and survival; therefore, we used an inhibitor of its receptor, CSF-1R, to target macrophages in a mouse proneural GBM model. more...

634. Engineering topology and kinetics of sucrose metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for improved ethanol yield
(Submitter supplied) Sucrose is a major carbon source for industrial bioethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeasts, two modes of sucrose metabolism occur: (i) extracellular hydrolysis by invertase, followed by uptake and metabolism of glucose and fructose, and (ii) uptake via sucrose-H+ symport followed by intracellular hydrolysis and metabolism. Although alternative start codons in the SUC2 gene enable synthesis of extracellular and intracellular invertase isoforms, sucrose hydrolysis in S. more...

635. Gene expression of primary MMTV-Neu tumors compared to secondary tumors generated from lin- and single tumor initiating cell (TIC) transplantation
(Submitter supplied) Most solid tumors seem to be organized in a hierarchy in which only a fraction of cells, termed tumor-initiating cells (TICs), is capable of disseminating new tumors after transplantation into recipient mice. However, whether a single TIC can induce a tumor or whether it requires additional TICs or non-TICs for tumor initiation is not known. Here we show that injections of single CD24+:Jag1- cells from Her2/Neu+ mammary tumors into recipient mammary glands induced tumors at a frequency of 1/22. more...

(Submitter supplied) It is generally accepted that human cancers derive from a mutated single cell. However, the genetic steps characterizing various stages of progression remain unclear. Studying a unique case of metastatic melanoma, we observed that cell lines derived from metachronous metastases arising over a decade retained a central core of genetic stability in spite of divergent phenotypes. In the present study we expanded our previous observations comparing these autologous cell lines of clonal derivation with heterologous ones and correlated array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) with gene expression profiling to determine their relative contribution to the dynamics of disease progression. more...

The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. more...

670. Downregulation of Myc is essential for terminal erythroid maturation
(Submitter supplied) Terminal differentiation of mammalian erythroid progenitors involves 4-5 cell divisions and induction of many erythroid important genes, followed by chromatin and nuclear condensation and enucleation. The protein levels of c-myc (Myc) are reduced dramatically during late stage erythroid maturation, coinciding with cell cycle arrest in G1-phase and enucleation, suggesting possible roles for c-myc in either or both of these processes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Memory B cells play essential roles in the maintenance of long-term immunity and may be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, but how these cells are distinguished from their naïve precursors is poorly understood. To address this, it would be important to understand how gene expression differs between memory and naive B cells in order to elucidate memory-specific functions. Using model systems that help overcome the lack of murine memory-specific markers and the low frequency of antigen-specific memory and naïve cells, we undertook a global comparison of gene expression between memory B cells and their naive precursors. more...

704. Immunodomination leads to selective expansion of the fittest CD8 T cells 
(Submitter supplied) During the course of infection, T cells are confronted with a multitude of non self epitopes but only respond to a few epitopes and neglect other potentially immunogenic peptides. Restriction of T cell responses to a small number of selected epitopes (immunodominance) is a central feature of immune responses. Immunodominance is considered to be disadvantageous to the host because it allows pathogens to escape by selectively mutating the relevant epitope(s). more...

Here, we explore whether a sporadic mutation that spontaneously arose in a hESC culture consisting of a single-copy deletion of chr17p13.1 would confer a survival advantage to the mutant cells. Compared to wild-type cells with two normal copies of the chr17p13.1 region, the mutant cells displayed a selective advantage when exposed to stressful conditions, and retained a higher percentage of pluripotent cells after two weeks of in vitro differentiation. more...

716.  Single-cell epigenomic variability reveals functional cancer heterogeneity
(Submitter supplied) Background: Cell-to-cell heterogeneity is a major driver of cancer evolution, progression, and emergence of drug resistance. Epigenomic variation at the single-cell level can rapidly create cancer heterogeneity, but is difficult to detect and assess functionally.  Results: We develop a strategy to bridge the gap between measurement and function in single-cell epigenomics. Using single-cell chromatin accessibility and RNA-seq data in K562 leukemic cells, we identify the cell surface marker CD24 as co-varying with chromatin accessibility changes linked to GATA transcription factors in single cells. more...

Granuloma macrophage subsets are diverse and carry varying copy numbers of their genomic information. The molecular programs that control the differentiation of such macrophage populations in response to a chronic stimulus, though critical for disease outcome, have not been defined. In this study, we performed scRNA-Seq experiments to gain insights into the transcriptional regulation of polyploid macrophage differentiation in response to chronically persistent inflammatory stimuli.

This study investigates changes in gene expression evoked in acute and adapted tetraploid cells and their impact on cell-cycle progression.  Acute polyploidy was generated by knockdown of essential regulator of cytokinesis Anillin, which resulted in cytokinesis failure and formation of binucleate cells, or by chemical inhibition of Aurora kinases, causing abnormal mitotic exit with formation of single cells with aberrant nuclear morphology. more...

(Submitter supplied) Stem-cell differentiation to desired lineages requires navigating alternating developmental paths that often lead to unwanted cell types. Hence, comprehensive developmental roadmaps are crucial to channel stem-cell differentiation toward desired fates. To this end, here, we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages, including bone, muscle, and heart. We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision, enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80%–99% pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints. more...

739. The ETS transcription factor Elf5 drives lung metastasis in luminal breast cancer via recruitment of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells [chronic]
(Submitter supplied) Elf5 expression in mammary progenitor cells regulates a cell fate decision that establishes the alveolar cell lineage. In luminal breast cancer cells, increased Elf5 expression suppressed estrogen receptor and FoxA1 expression and was implicated in the acquisition of resistance to the cytostatic effects of antiestrogen therapy. We show that in the PyMT model of luminal breast cancer, increased Elf5 expression drives lung metastasis by recruiting myeloid-­‐derived suppressor cells, and that this activity overcomes the epithelializing influence of Elf5. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tfh cells are required for T cell help to B cells, and BCL6 is the defining transcription factor of Tfh cells. However, the functions of Bcl6 in Tfh have largely remained unclear. Here we defined the BCL6 cistrome in primary human germinal center Tfh cells to assess mechanisms of BCL6 regulation of CD4 T cells, comparing and contrasting BCL6 function in T and B cells. BCL6 primarily acts as a repressor in Tfh cells, and BCL6 binding was associated with control of Tfh cell migration, TCR signaling, and repression of alternative cell fates. Interestingly, although some BCL6 bound genes possessed BCL6 DNA binding motifs, many BCL6-bound loci were instead characterized by the presence of DNA motifs for AP1 or STAT. more...

(Submitter supplied) Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to isolate cells from the principal critical micro-regions, whose development, differentiation and signaling interactions are responsible for the construction of the mammalian face. At E8.5, as migrating neural crest cells begin to exit the neural fold/epidermal ectoderm boundary, we examined the facial mesenchyme, composed of neural crest and paraxial mesoderm cells, as well as cells from adjacent neuroepithelium. more...

808. Single cell Hi-C reveals cell-to-cell variability in chromosome structure
(Submitter supplied) Large-scale chromosome structure and spatial nuclear arrangement have been linked to control of gene expression and DNA replication and repair. Genomic techniques based on chromosome conformation capture assess contacts for millions of loci simultaneously, but do so by averaging chromosome conformations from millions of nuclei. Here we introduce single cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide statistical analysis and structural modeling of single copy X chromosomes, to show that individual chromosomes maintain domain organisation at the megabase scale, but show variable cell-to-cell chromosome territory structures at larger scales. more...

810. Identification of DNA-replication domains in single S-phase cells: part 4 whole genome amplified single-cell DNA
(Submitter supplied) DNA-replication is a key process in life and can lead to disease when disturbed. Cell-type specific early and late replication domains have been discovered throughout genomes by analysis of DNA from populations of cells. However, cell to cell differences and the association of these differences with other cellular processes remain largely elusive. Here we demonstrate for the first time that consecutive domains of early and late DNA-replication can be detected in single S-phase cells using array comparative genomic hybridization, providing proof-of-concept for a novel tool to investigate DNA-replication genome wide at the single-cell level. more...

818. Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers Reveals Tumor Cell of Origin in Glioma
(Submitter supplied) Cancer results from molecular mutations occurring in specific cell types, thus determining the cell-of-origin is critical for effective cancer treatment. Inferring such information from terminal tumors can be misleading because malignant tumor cells tend to acquire aberrant properties. Animal models are widely used because one can initiate mutations in specific cell types. However, cell-of-mutation that harbors initial molecular changes may not directly transform, rather merely passes along mutations to its progeny cell lineage, which then serves as cell-of-origin and finally transforms into malignancy. more...

830. A model of breast cancer heterogeneity reveals vascular mimicry as a driver of metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites1. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions2   5. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. more...

It is essential for normal embryonic development and haematopoiesis and frequently mutated in cancer.

However, this process is highly inefficient and most cloned embryos arrest at certain developmental stages. Through single cell sequencing combined with embryo biopsy, here we generate a global map of DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome for SCNT embryos with distinct developmental fates. We subsequently demonstrate that the unfaithful reactivation of two histone demethylases, Kdm4b and Kdm5b, accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at 2-cell and 4-cell stage, respectively. more...

845. Loss of lamin B1 results in prolongation of S-phase and decondensation of chromosome territories in the interphase nucleus of mammalian cells
(Submitter supplied) Nuclear lamin B1 constitutes one of the major structural proteins in the lamina mesh. We silenced the expression of lamin B1 by RNA interference in the colon cancer cell line DLD-1 and showed a dramatic redistribution of H3K27me3 from the periphery to a more homogeneous nuclear dispersion; in addition we observed an increased frequency of micronuclei and nuclear blebs. By 3D-FISH analyses, we demonstrate that the volume and surface of chromosome territories were significantly larger in LMNB1-depleted cells, suggesting that lamin B1 is required to maintain chromatin condensation in interphase nuclei. more...

(Submitter supplied) Thymic iNKT cell development is divided into four stages (stage 0-3) that are characterised, in C57BL/6 mouse strain, by the differential expression of surface markers, such as CD24, CD44 and NK1.1. During transition from immature to mature iNKT cell subsets, gene expression is tightly regulated. Here, we used microarray analysis to detail the influence of the transcriptional regulator ID3 during iNKT cell maturation in the thymus.

880. Two Forkhead transcription factors regulate cardiac progenitor specification by controlling the expression of receptors of the fibroblast growth factor and Wnt signaling pathways
(Submitter supplied) Cardiogenesis involves multiple biological processes acting in concert during development, a coordination achieved by the regulation of diverse cardiac genes by a finite set of transcription factors (TFs).  Previous work from our laboratory identified the roles of two Forkhead TFs, Checkpoint suppressor homologue (CHES-1-like) and Jumeau (Jumu) in governing cardiac progenitor cell divisions by regulating Polo kinase activity. more...

881. Single Cell Analysis Reveals Unexpected Transcriptional Heterogeneity of Neural Progenitors in the Developing Human Cortex
(Submitter supplied) The human cerebral cortex depends for its normal development and size on a precisely controlled balance between self-renewal and differentiation of diverse neural progenitor cells. Specialized progenitors that are common in humans, but virtually absent in rodents, called ‘outer radial glia’ (ORG), have been suggested to be crucial to the evolutionary expansion of the human cortex. We combined cell type-specific sorting with transcriptome-wide RNA-sequencing to identify genes enriched in human ORG, including targets of the transcription factor Neurogenin, and previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily dynamic, long noncoding RNAs. more...

883. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of secretagogin mRNA expressing cells from the mouse hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus
(Submitter supplied) The molecular mechanism regulating phasic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from parvocellular neurons (PVN) remains poorly understood. Here, we find a cohort of parvocellular cells interspersed with magnocellular PVN neurons expressing secretagogin. Single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with protein interactome profiling identifies secretagogin neurons as a distinct CRH-releasing neuron population reliant on secretagogin’s Ca2+ sensor properties and protein interactions with the vesicular traffic and exocytosis release machineries to liberate this key hypothalamic releasing hormone.

(Submitter supplied) Skeletal muscles are formed in a variety of shapes and sizes, and this diversity impacts muscle function and disease susceptibility. To understand how muscle diversity is generated, we performed gene expression profiling of muscle subsets from Drosophila embryos. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of two muscle subsets, we identified a core group of founder cell-enriched genes. We screened mutant embryos for muscle defects and identified Sin3A and 10 other transcription and chromatin regulators as having novel functions in the Drosophila embryonic somatic musculature. more...

Set-beta’s subcellular localization is regulated by posttranslational modifications. We found that Set-beta suppresses neurite growth of purified postnatal rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) primary neurons when it is overexpressed in the nucleus, whereas recruiting Set-beta to cellular membrane by fusing myr-tag to its N-terminus promotes neurite growth. more...

887. Wnt signalling sustains an EpiSCs subpopulation similar to primitive streak with increased mesendodermal potency
(Submitter supplied) During gastrulation, epiblast cells are pluripotent and their fate is thought to be constrained principally by their position.  Cell fate is progressively restricted by localised signalling cues from areas including the primitive streak (PS). However, it is unknown whether this restriction accompanies, at the single cell level, a reduction in potency.  Investigation of these early transition events in vitro is possible via the use of Epiblast Stem Cells (EpiSCs), self-renewing pluripotent cell lines equivalent to the postimplantation epiblast. more...

896. CpG islands and GC content dictate nucleosome depletion in a transcription independent manner at mammalian promoters (ChIP-seq)
(Submitter supplied) One clear hallmark of mammalian promoters is the presence of CpG islands (CGIs) at more than two thirds of genes whereas TATA boxes are only present at a minority of promoters. Using genome-wide approaches, we show that GC content and CGIs are major promoter elements in mammalian cells, able to govern open chromatin conformation and support paused transcription. First, we define three classes of promoters with distinct transcriptional directionality and pausing properties which correlate with their GC content. more...

900. Single Cell based genomewide gene expression analysis of murine bone-marrow derived Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELs)
(Submitter supplied) Recently, we identified a population of Oct4+Sca-1+Lin-CD45- very small embryonic-like stem-cells (VSELs) in adult tissues. Open chromatin structure of pluripotency genes and genomic imprinting-related epigenetic mechanisms maintain pluripotency and quiescence of VSELs, respectively. However, global transcriptome signature of this rare stem-cell population remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate by genomewide gene-expression analysis with a small number of highly purified murine bone-marrow (BM)-derived VSELs, that Oct4+ VSELs i) express a similar, yet nonidentical, transcriptome as embryonic stem-cells (ESCs), ii) up-regulate cell-cycle checkpoint genes, iii) down-regulate genes involved in protein turnover and mitogenic pathways, and iv) highly express Ezh2, a polycomb group protein. more...

However, exclusive stem cell markers are lacking, and therefore the true identity of MaSCs, including their location, multiplicity, dynamics and fate during branching morphogenesis, has yet to be defined. more...

917. Gene expression profile of colon endothelial cells in early GVHD with Microarray
(Submitter supplied) During inflammatory diseases, infiltrating immune cells can induce endothelial activation and angiogenesis by cytokines and other mediators. The inhibition of inflammation-associated angiogenesis ameliorates inflammatory diseases by reducing the recruitment of tissue infiltrating leukocytes. However, there is limited evidence on initial mechanisms of both processes. We show in experimental models that angiogenesis precedes leukocyte infiltration during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). more...

950. Gene Expression Profiling of Fibroblasts in Actute Kidney Injury
(Submitter supplied) Fibroblasts are present in every organ. While the role fibroblasts in chronic diseases such as fibrosis or tumor expression has been extensively explored, little is known about their physiological role. The kidney possesses a unique capacity to recover from even severe acute injury. We study molecular mechanisms of this intrinsic repair capacity in the mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR). In this model, the renal artery and vein are clamped for 45 min, leading to acute kidney injury. more...

951. Defining a mesenchymal progenitor niche at single cell resolution
(Submitter supplied) Most vertebrate organs are composed of epithelium surrounded by support and stromal tissues formed from mesenchyme cells, which are not generally thought to form organized progenitor pools.  Here we use clonal cell labeling with multicolor reporters to characterize individual mesenchymal progenitors in the developing mouse lung.  We observe a diversity of mesenchymal progenitor populations with different locations, movements, and lineage boundaries. more...

952. Early lineage restriction and regional segregation during mammalian heart development
(Submitter supplied) Cardiac development arises from two sources of mesoderm progenitors, the first (FHF) and the second heart field (SHF). Mesp1 has been proposed to mark the most primitive multipotent cardiac progenitors common for both heart fields. Here, using clonal analysis of the earliest prospective cardiovascular progenitors in a temporally controlled manner during the early gastrulation, we found that Mesp1 progenitors consist of two temporally distinct pools of progenitors restricted to either the FHF or the SHF. more...

(Submitter supplied) Naïve mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and primed epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) represent successive snapshots of pluripotency during embryogenesis. Using transcriptomic and epigenomic mapping, we show that a small fraction of transcripts are differentially expressed between mESCs and mEpiSCs and these genes show expected changes in chromatin at their promoters and enhancers. Unexpectedly, the cis-regulatory circuitry of genes that are expressed at identical levels between these cell states also differs dramatically. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ensuring cooperation among formerly autonomous cells has been a central challenge in the evolution of multicellular organisms. One solution is monoclonality, but this option does not eliminate genetic and epigenetic variability, leaving room for exploitative behavior. We therefore hypothesized that embryonic development must be protected by robust regulatory mechanisms that prevent aberrant clones from superseding wild-type cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cancer-host interactions play an important role in cancer development.  We identified ATF3, an adaptive-response gene, in the host to facilitate metastasis.  We also demonstrated that the macrophage is one of the key cell types for host-ATF3 to function.  Furthermore, matrix metalloproteases 9 is a functionally important target gene of ATF3 in co-culture assays.  Gene profiling with bioinformatics analyses indicated that ATF3 downstream gene-signatures derived from tumor-associated macrophages in a mouse model can distinguish human tumor stroma from “distant” stroma in and can stratify the patients into high- versus low-risk groups. more...

(Submitter supplied) Single-cell RNA -seq can precisely resolve cellular states, but applying this method to low-input samples is challenging. Here, we present Seq-Well, a portable, low-cost platform for massively parallel single-cell RNA -seq. Barcoded mRNA capture beads and single cells are sealed in an array of subnanoliter wells using a semipermeable membrane, enabling efficient cell lysis and transcript capture. We characterize Seq-Well extensively and use it to profile thousands of primary human macrophages exposed to tuberculosis.

To address the role of replication-independent histone deposition, we deleted the histone H3.3 chaperone Hira in developing mouse oocytes. We show that chromatin of non-replicative developing oocytes is highly dynamic, and that lack of continuous H3.3/H4 deposition alters chromatin structure, resulting in increased DNase I sensitivity, the accumulation of DNA damage, and, ultimately, a severe fertility phenotype. more...

1020. Gene expression profiles of Lkb1 WT and KO hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
(Submitter supplied) LKB1 encodes a Ser/Thr kinase and acts as an evolutionarily conserved sensor of cellular energy status in eukaryotic cells. LKB1 functions as the major upstream kinase to phosphorylate AMPK and 12 other AMPK-related kinases, which is required for their activation in many cellular contexts. Once activated, AMPK and AMPK-related kinases phosphorylate a diverse array of downstream effectors to switch on ATP-generating catabolic processes and switch off ATP-consuming anabolic processes, thus restoring energy balance during periods of energetic stress. more...

(Submitter supplied) Deletions within the human IKZF1 gene, which encodes Ikaros, a zinc finger transcription factor critical for lymphopoiesis, appear to be the most prominent recurring lesion in human BCR-ABL1+ (Ph+) B-ALL. Furthermore, IKZF1 mutations correlate with poor prognosis of progenitor B-ALL, further strengthening the notion that IKZF1 is a critical tumor suppressor gene in human B-lineage malignancies. To better understand the relationship between Ikzf1 mutations, BCR-ABL, and B-lineage leukemia, we examined the effect of two newly generated Ikzf1 germline mutation on BCR-ABL-induced proliferation and leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (Macf1) plays a role in coordinated actions of actin and microtubules in multiple cellular processes. Here we show that Macf1 is also critical for ciliogenesis in multiple cell types. Ablation of Macf1 in the developing retina abolishes ciliogenesis and basal bodies fail to dock to ciliary vesicles or migrate apically. Photoreceptor polarity is randomized while inner retinal cells laminate correctly, suggesting that photoreceptor maturation is guided by polarity cues provided by cilia. more...

1094. Microarray expression profiling study of Runx1-null and wild type luminal mammary epithelial cells
(Submitter supplied) RUNX1 encodes a RUNX family transcription factor (TF) and was recently identified as a novel mutated gene in human luminal breast cancers. We found that Runx1 is expressed in all subpopulations of murine mammary epithelial cells (MECs) except the secretory alveolar luminal cells. Conditional knockout of Runx1 in MECs by MMTV-Cre led to a decrease in luminal MECs, largely due to a profound reduction in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive mature luminal subpopulation, a phenotype that could be rescued by loss of either Trp53 or Rb1. more...

1095. Endogenous miRNA and target concentrations determine susceptibility to potential ceRNA competition, based on hierarchical binding affinities (mRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Target competition (ceRNA crosstalk) within miRNA-regulated gene networks has been proposed to influence biological systems. To assess target competition, we characterize and quantitate miRNA networks in two cell types. Argonaute iCLIP reveals that hierarchical binding of high to low affinity miRNA targets is a key characteristic of in vivo activity. Quantification of cellular miRNA and mRNA/ncRNA target pool levels indicates that miRNA-Target pool ratios and an affinity partitioned target pool accurately predict in vivo Ago binding profiles and miRNA susceptibility to target competition. more...

1123. Comparing gene expression between PICs and satellite cells from 1 week old muscle
(Submitter supplied) The satellite cell is considered the major tissue-resident stem cell underlying muscle regeneration, however, multiple non-satellite cell myogenic progenitors have been identified. PW1/Peg3 is expressed in satellite cells as well as a subset of interstitial cells with myogenic potential termed PICs (PW1+ Interstitial Cells). PICs differ from satellite cells by their anatomical location (satellite cells are sublaminal and PICs are interstitial), they do not express any myogenic marker and arise from a Pax3-independent lineage. more...

1125. Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) promotes hepatocarcinogenesis: novel insights from a mouse model
(Submitter supplied) Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) as a positive inducer of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transgenic mice with hepatocyte-specific expression of AEG-1 were challenged with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and developed multinodular HCC with steatotic features. Thus, we have identified the follwoing AEG-1 functions: induction of steatosis, inhibition of senescence and activation of coagulation pathway to augment an aggressive hepatocarcinogenic phenotype.

(Submitter supplied) Klf1 (formerly known as Eklf) regulates the development of erythroid cells from bi-potent progenitor cells via the transcriptional activation of a diverse set of genes. Mice lacking Klf1 die in utero prior to E15 from severe anemia due to the inadequate expression of genes controlling hemoglobin production, cell membrane and cytoskeletal integrity, and the cell cycle and proliferation. We have recently described the full repertoire of Klf1 binding sites in vivo by performing Klf1 ChIP-seq in primary erythroid tissue (E14.5 fetal liver). more...

Their existence has been supported mainly by the observation that both cell types develop in close proximity and by in vitro differentiation and genetic studies. However, more compelling evidence will arise from tracking their cell fates using a lineage-specific marker. We report the identification of a hemangioblast-specific enhancer (Hb) located in the cis-regulatory region of chick Cerberus gene (cCer) that is able to direct the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to the precursors of yolk sac blood and endothelial cells in electroporated chick embryos. more...

(Submitter supplied) Argonaute2 proteins (Ago2) are key component of RNA-induced gene silencing complexes (RISCs), which is crucial for microRNAs to repress target genes. The function of Ago2 for oogenesis is unknown due to early embryonic lethal of Ago2 knockout mice. Here we show the effect of loss of Ago2 in mouse oogenesis by specific deletion of it in growing oocyte. Although the Ago2-deficient oocytes can develop to mature oocytes, they have abnormal spindle and the chromosomes that can’t cluster together properly, which are very similar to the phenotype of Dicer-deficient oocytes. more...

1167. The effect of mutations in AtrbohC on the pattern of gene expression in primary root tissue.
(Submitter supplied) Aim:  To determine the effect of an AtrbohC mutation on the gene expression pattern in primary root tissue, to identify candidate genes acting downstream of AtrbohC, particularly any encoding antioxidant-related proteins, signal transduction components or proteins known to be required for normal root-hair development. Background:  Root-hairs are a model system for investigating plant cell polarity. The root-hair mutant rhd2 (Schiefelbein and Somerville, 1990. Plant Cell, 2:235) has short hairs that burst at their tips, (Jones and Smirnoff, unpublished). RHD2 has been cloned and is identical to AtrbohC (L. Dolan, pers. comm.), which encodes a homologue of the superoxide-generating neutrophil respiratory burst oxidase catalytic subunit gp91phox (Torres et al., 1998. Plant J., 14:365). Superoxide rapidly dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), suggesting that the rhd2 phenotype may result from reduced H2O2 levels in root-hair cells. Low doses of exogenous antioxidants phenocopy the rhd2 root-hair phenotype in wild-type plants (Jones and Smirnoff, unpublished) further supporting a role for H2O2 in root-hair growth. Fluorescent dyes that detect H2O2 show distinct localisation patterns in growing root-hair cells, (Jones and Smirnoff, unpublished). H2O2 may be an important second messenger in plant cell signalling with proposed roles in the development of cotton fibres (Potikha et al., 1999. Plant Physiol., 119: 849) and in ABA-induced stomatal closure (Zhang et al., 2001. Plant Physiol., 126: 1438). In cultured Arabidopsis cells H2O2 induces gene expression, including that of a gp91phox homologue, (Desikan et al., 1998. J. Exp. Bot., 49: 1767; Desikan, et al., 2000. Free Rad. Biol. Med., 28: 773; Baxter-Burrell et al., 2002. Science, 296: 2026) and activates a MAP kinase cascade (Desikan et al., 1999. J. Exp Bot., 50: 1863). cDNA microarray technology has been used previously to examine the effects of H2O2 on gene expression during oxidative stress (Desikan et al., 2001. Plant Physiol., 127: 159). We wish to investigate the effects of H2O2 on gene expression during root development using the rhd2 mutant. We are currently determining the expression pattern of RHD2. By extracting RNA from the small region of the primary root (for wild-type and rhd2 plants grown in sterile conditions) where root hairs are growing we hope to enrich for root-hair RNAs. This may reveal candidate genes that could be examined more closely at the single-cell level. This approach will provide new insights into the role of H2O2 in root-hair development.

(Submitter supplied) Stable maintenance of gene regulatory programs is essential for normal function in multi-cellular organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms, and DNA methylation in particular, are hypothesized to facilitate such maintenance by creating cellular memory that can be written during embryonic development and then guide cell-type specific gene expression. Here we use new methods to study distributions of DNA methylation patterns within cell populations to show that embryonic stem cells preserve their epigenetic state by balancing antagonistic processes that add and remove methylation marks rather than by copying epigenetic information from mother to daughter cells. more...

1191. microRNA expression profiling of human myeloid precursors
(Submitter supplied) Hemopoiesis entails a series of hierarchically organized events that proceed throughout cell specification and terminates with cell differentiation. Commitment needs the transcription factors effort that, in concert with microRNAs, drives cell fate specification, answering to promiscuous patterns of gene expression by turning on lineage-specific genes and repressing alternate lineage transcripts. Therefore microRNAs and mRNAs cooperate to direct cell fate decisions. more...

1193. A function for interleukin 2 in Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells
(Submitter supplied) Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing the forkhead family transcription factor Foxp3 are critical mediators of dominant immune tolerance to self. Most Treg cells constitutively express the high-affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor alpha-chain (CD25); however, the precise function of IL-2 in Treg cell biology has remained controversial. To directly assess the effect of IL-2 signaling on Treg cell development and function, we analyzed mice containing the Foxp3gfp knock-in allele that were genetically deficient in either IL-2 (Il2-/-) or CD25 (Il2ra-/-). more...

A population of cytotoxic CD4 T cells can be generated against influenza challenge, however identifying these cells have been challenging. The expression of NKG2A/C/E on CD4 T cells identifies CD4 T cells with cytotoxic potential thus allowing further characterization of this subset of CD4 effector cells. Microarray analysis comparing cytotoxic CD4 T cells versus non-cytotoxic CD4 T cells reveals unique differences in localization between these populations in the lung after influenza A challenge.

1226. Chd1 is essential for the high transcriptional output and rapid growth of the mouse epiblast
(Submitter supplied) The pluripotent mammalian epiblast undergoes unusually fast cell proliferation. This rapid growth is expected to generate a high transcriptional demand, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We report that the chromatin remodeler Chd1, which binds the activating histone mark H3K4me3 and is associated with transcription, is required for development of the mouse epiblast. Chd1-/- embryos exhibit proliferation defects and increased apoptosis, are smaller than controls by E5.5, and fail to grow, become patterned or gastrulate. more...

1227. Gene expression profiles of lymphoma cells in homozygous Tet2 gene trap mice and CD4+ control cells.
(Submitter supplied) TET2 is an enzyme for converting methylcytosine (mC) to hydorxymethylcytosine (hmC) and its mutations have been frequently found in myeloid malignancies and T-cell lymphoma in humans. We analyzed Tet2 gene trap mice and found that homozygous mice developed T-cell lymphoma with follicular helper T-cell-like features. To examine comprehensive gene expression patterns of lymphoma cells, We performed gene expression analysis using lymphoma cells in homozygousTet2 gene trap mice and CD4+ control cells.

Self-renewal is dependent on extrinsic niche factors but few of those signals have been identified. We show that adult mammary glands contain a Wnt-responsive cell population that is enriched for stem cells. In cell culture experiments, exposure to purified Wnt protein clonally expands mammary stem cells for many generations and maintains their ability to generate functional glands in transplantation assays. more...

Here we studied the function of Rcor1 in vivo and showed it is essential to erythropoeisis during embryonic development. Rcor1 mutant proerythroblasts, unlike normal cells, can form myeloid colonies in vitro. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms for block of erythropoiesis and increased myeloid potential, we used RNA-seq to reveal the differentially expressed genes from erythroid progenitors due to depletion of Rcor1.

Recently, it was shown that the single-cell genome-NL interactions are much more dynamic than previously anticipated, which challenges the concept of the NL as a safe guard for transcriptional repressed genes. Here we discuss the role of the NL in light of these new findings and introduce Lamin A and BAF as potential modulators of LAD positioning

It is also firmly established that their aberrant generation and activation results in autoimmune conditions. Using a characterized potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, we show that the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family of chromatin adaptors plays fundamental and selective roles in human and murine TH17 differentiation from naïve CD4+ T cells, as well as in the activation of previously differentiated TH17 cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) During embryogenesis, many key transcription factors are used repeatedly, achieving different outcomes depending on cell type and developmental stage. The epigenetic modification of the genome functions as a memory of a cell’s developmental history, and it has been proposed that such modification shapes the cellular response to transcription factors. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in the response to transcription factor Gata4, we have tried to identify GATA4-binding associated genes of WT-type and Dnmt3a-/-Dnmt3b-/-(DKO) in Flk1-based mesoderm progenitor by Gata4 ChIP-analysis.

(Submitter supplied) Developing CD4+ T-cells in the thymus mature from CD69+Qa2- cells to CD69-Qa2+ T-cells. This maturation is accombanied by increased expression of CD62L and S1PR1 in Qa2+ cells, which allows mature T-cells to emigrate from the thymus to the periphery. However, miR-142-/- mice are characterized by an altered thymocytes homeostasis, characterized by reduced CD62L protein levels on their cell surface. To characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms, which lead to reduced CD62L expression in miR-142-/- CD4+ thymocytes, we investigated the mRNA levels in immature Qa2- as well as mature Qa2+ thymocytes isolated ex vivo from WT and miR-142 deficient Bl6 mice.

How these various structures are established is poorly understood, but we propose that specific histone H2A variants will have a key role in remodelling chromatin during differentiation. Structurally, we show here that the gain of just a single acidic amino acid residue has generated a new mouse H2A.Bbd-like histone variant, H2A.Lap1, and that when incorporated into nucleosomal arrays imparts on them unique biophysical properties that are distinct from arrays containing either H2A or human H2A.Bbd. more...

1259. Gene expression data in Bone Marrow Derived Dendritic Cells (BMDC) following nanoemulsion adjuvant exposure
(Submitter supplied) Antigen uptake, processing and presentation by dendritic cells are regulated by complex intra- and inter-cellular signalling events.  Typical vaccine adjuvants lead to the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which relate to immune induction. We used microarrays to detail the global expression of genes in BMDC underlying emulsion internalization and DC activation with a non-inflammatory nanoemulsion adjuvant.

1260. Dynamic single-cell imaging of direct reprogramming reveals an early specifying event
(Submitter supplied) The study of induced pluripotency often relies on experimental approaches that average measurements across a large population of cells, the majority of which do not become pluripotent. Here we used high-resolution, time-lapse imaging to trace the reprogramming process over 2 weeks from single mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to pluripotency factor-positive colonies. This enabled us to calculate a normalized cell-of-origin reprogramming efficiency that takes into account only the initial MEFs that respond to form reprogrammed colonies rather than the larger number of final colonies. more...

1261. CD44+ or CD44– tumor cells isolated from K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice
(Submitter supplied) We hypothesized that CD44+ tumor cells might have an increased capacity for reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense in the gastric tumors of K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice. To address this possibility, we examined the expression of antioxidant genes in tumor cells isolated from K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Lineage marker (Lin)–negative cells that were CD44+ or CD44– were thus isolated from the gastric tumors of 30-week-old K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. more...

We investigated the transcriptional regulation of the AID gene, Aicda, in the class switch–inducible CH12F3-2 cells, and found that the Aicda regulation involves derepression by several layers of positive regulatory elements in addition to the 5’ promoter region. The 5’ upstream region contains functional motifs for the response to signaling by cytokines, CD40-ligand, or stimuli that activate NF-κB. more...

1265. Langerhans cells from aryl hydrocarbon receptor deficient mice
(Submitter supplied) The arylhydrocarbon receptor is a ligand inducible transcription factor. Known to control xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, it also affects - depending on the cell type - numerous other genes, either directly or indirectly. With respect to the immune system, persistent activation leads to immunosuppression. We asked how the AhR is involved in Langerhans cells. These antigen presenting cells of the skin are responsible for allergies against chemicals (thus xenobiotic metabolism might be relevant) and a recently detected endogenous ligand, FICZ made by UVB radiation from tryptophane, is particularly abundant in the skin. more...

(Submitter supplied) Particularly in the context of differentiation and development, the importance of three-dimensional chromatin architecture to gene regulatory mechanisms is becoming increasingly clear.  The most ancient known mechanism of chromatin organization involves TFIIIC, a transcription factor (TF) that recruits RNA polymerase III (Pol III) for transcription of tRNA and other types of non-coding RNA genes. From yeast to mammals, TFIIIC binds to tRNA genes (tDNAs) and scattered “extra-TFIIIC” (ETC) loci and serves to tether these loci together as anchors of chromatin loops. more...

Estimates of chromosomal mutation rates per generation based on cytogenetic analyses of newborns and products of conception, range between 4.57x10-5 and 3.42x10-4. In contrast, the high incidence of segmental imbalances detected by single-cell genome-wide copy number profiling indicates that the error rate per cell division might be more than an order of magnitude higher. more...

(Submitter supplied) Many bacteria colonize surfaces and transition to a sessile mode of growth. The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens produces a unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) adhesin at single cell poles that contact surfaces. Here we report that elevated levels of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) lead to surface-contact-independent UPP production and a red colony phenotype due to production of UPP and the exopolysaccharide cellulose, when A. more...

1296. Functional phenotypes alteration on dendritic cells between tolerance and immnunity
(Submitter supplied) Dendritic cells (DC) are key regulators of immunological responses, immunity and tolerance. Due to their differentiation capacities, they have emerged as a promising tool for therapeutic applications. However, there are poorly understood functional DC-specific markers and cellular mechanisms for in-vitro research and clinical usage.   This study’s aim is to evaluate the gene expression profiling of  up-regulated or down-regulated by DC maturation and explore their function. more...

1298. Identification of DNA-replication domains in single S-phase cells: part 3 multi-cell controls
(Submitter supplied) DNA-replication is a key process in life and can lead to disease when disturbed. Cell-type specific early and late replication domains have been discovered throughout genomes by analysis of DNA from populations of cells. However, cell to cell differences and the association of these differences with other cellular processes remain largely elusive. Here we demonstrate for the first time that consecutive domains of early and late DNA-replication can be detected in single S-phase cells using array comparative genomic hybridization, providing proof-of-concept for a novel tool to investigate DNA-replication genome wide at the single-cell level. more...

(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning work together to generate chromatin structures that regulate gene expression. Nucleosomes are typically mapped using nuclease digestion requiring significant amounts of material and varying enzyme concentrations. We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand. more...

RcGTA is a phage-like particle that packages R. capsulatus DNA and transfers it to other R. capsulatus cells. Low-resolution techniques suggested RcGTA packages random DNA. Analysis of the RcGTA terminase sequence revealed a distant relationship to the phage T4 terminase protein, which can also perform sequence-independent packaging. more...

1306. Gene expression in clonogenic versus non-clonogenic in pooled early passage OCI/AML-4 single cells
(Submitter supplied) Identification of genes that regulate clonogenicity of AML cells is hindered by the difficulty of isolating pure populations of cells with defined proliferative abilities.  Using early passages of the OCI/AML-4 cell line we sought to determine genes differentially expressed between clonogenic and non-clonogenic cells. We previously shown that OCI/AML-4 clonal siblings display coordinated growth patterns, so that the behaviour of a single cell that is destroyed in the generation of global single cell cDNA may be predicted by the growth patterns of its clonal siblings. more...

The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. more...

Although ICM-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells are normally unable to contribute to the trophectoderm (TE) in blastocysts, we find that depletion of Eset by shRNAs leads to differentiation with the formation of trophoblast-like cells and induction of trophoblast-associated gene expression. more...

1312. Genome-wide analysis of murine cardiomyocytes at different developmental stages
(Submitter supplied) Cardiomyocytes exhibit differential growth patterns throughout development. In fetal life the increase in cardiac mass is associated with hyperplastic growth and cardiomyocyte proliferation. The majority of fetal cardiomyocytes are also mononucleated. During the early neonatal period in mice there is a switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes. This period is characterized by bi-nucleation and polyploidization of cardiomyocyte nuclei and a decreased capacity for cardiomyocytes to proliferate and complete cytokinesis. more...

1313. The growth factor environment defines distinct pluripotent ground states in novel blastocyst derived stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Pluripotent stem cell lines can be derived from blastocyst embryos, which yield embryonic stem cell lines (ES cells), as well as the post-implantation epiblast, which gives rise to epiblast stem cell lines (EpiSCs). Remarkably, ES cells and EpiSCs display profound differences in the combination of growth factors that maintain their pluripotent state. Molecular and functional differences between these two stem cell types demonstrate that the tissue of origin and/or the growth factor milieu may be important determinants of the stem cell identity. more...

1314. Role of thrombospondin-1 in T cell response to ocular pigment epithelial cells.
(Submitter supplied) Ocular pigment epithelium (PE) cells promote the generation of T regulators (PE-induced Treg cells). Moreover, T cells exposed to PE acquire the capacity to suppress the activation of bystander T cells via TGFbeta. Membrane-bound TGFbeta on iris PE cells interacts with TGFbeta receptors on T cells, leading to the conversion of T cells to CD8(+) Treg cells via a cell contact-dependent mechanism. Conversely, soluble forms of TGFbeta produced by retinal PE cells can convert CD4(+) T cells into Treg cells in a manner that is independent of cell contact. more...

The methylation on the promoter leads to the suppression of gene expression, while the functional role of gene body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified.

1354. Identification of transcriptome of mouse non-neural ectoderm during nueral tube closure and gene enrichment compared to remaining neural tube tissue
(Submitter supplied) The process of neural tube closure is a highly complex morphogenetic event that results in the generation of the primordial central nervous system. During formation of the neural tube, the non-neural ectoderm separates from the neighboring neural ectoderm and forms a single layer epithelial sheet that overlies the closed neural tube. Previous work has shown that the non-neural ectoderm is necessary for proper cranial neural tube closure, however little is known about this cell population at the molecular level or how the non-neural ectoderm contributes to neural tube closure. more...

To assess target competition, we characterize and quantitate miRNA networks in two cell types. Argonaute iCLIP reveals that hierarchical binding of high to low affinity miRNA targets is a key characteristic of in vivo activity. Quantification of cellular miRNA and mRNA/ncRNA target pool levels indicates that miRNA-Target pool ratios and an affinity partitioned target pool accurately predict in vivo Ago binding profiles and miRNA susceptibility to target competition. more...

1472. Identification of genes expressed preferentially in the developing peripheral margin of the optic cup 
(Submitter supplied) Identification of genes expressed in a preferential manner in the developing ciliary body/iris will provide a starting point for future functional analyses.  To identify candidate genes expressed in a variety of ocular tissues during development, we have profiled single cells from the developing eye. Post hoc identification of the origin of these cells showed that they included cells from the periphery of the developing optic cup. more...

(Submitter supplied) Adult (6- to 8-week-old) C57BL/6 purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) were used as donors ocular pigment epithelium (PE). To cultivate retinal PE (RPE) eyes were cut into two parts along a circumferential line posterior to the ciliary process, creating a ciliary body-deficient posterior eyecup.  The eyecup was then incubated in 0.2% trypsin (Biowhitaker) for 1 hr.  These tissues were triturated to make a single cell suspension, and then re-suspended in the medium. more...

1474. SAGE Libraries from Highly Purified Mouse Hematopoietic Stem Cells from the E14.5 Fetal Liver and Adult Bone Marrow
(Submitter supplied) Recent improvements in the development of methods for isolating functionally validated populations of nearly pure (>20%) murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have made it possible to analyze the molecular basis of the properties of these cells with increased precision. One intriguing feature of HSCs is the change they undergo in many of their key properties during development a change that affects the control of their self-renewal, cycling status, differentiated progeny output and steel factor sensitivity. more...

1479. Characterization of the small RNAs of Volvox carteri associated with an Argonaute protein
(Submitter supplied) The green alga Volvox carteri is a model organism for the development of multicellularity. It has a spherical shape with a complete division of labor between around 2000 somatic cells and 16 reproductive cells. When comparing Volvox with its unicellular relative Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii, one striking observation is the similarity in the protein coding genes [1]. Additionally, Baulcombe and colleagues showed that Chlamydomonas contains functional RNAi and miRNA machineries [2]. more...

1563. Genome-wide maps of nuclear lamina interactions in single human cells (CEL-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Mammalian interphase chromosomes interact with the nuclear lamina (NL) through hundreds of large Lamina Associated Domains (LADs). We report a method to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of ~400 maps reveals a core architecture of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts are more sensitive to a change in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. more...

(Submitter supplied) Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) is a γ-herpesvirus (γ-HV) carried asymptomatically by wildebeest. Upon cross-species transmission, AlHV-1 induces an acute and fatal lymphoproliferative disease named malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) in many ruminants, including cattle and the rabbit model. Latency has been shown to be essential for MCF induction. However, the mechanisms causing the activation and proliferation of infected CD8+ T cells are unknown. more...

1569. Endogenous miRNA and target concentrations determine susceptibility to potential ceRNA competition, based on hierarchical binding affinities (small RNA)
(Submitter supplied) Target competition (ceRNA crosstalk) within miRNA-regulated gene networks has been proposed to influence biological systems. To assess target competition, we characterize and quantitate miRNA networks in two cell types. Argonaute iCLIP reveals that hierarchical binding of high to low affinity miRNA targets is a key characteristic of in vivo activity. Quantification of cellular miRNA and mRNA/ncRNA target pool levels indicates that miRNA-Target pool ratios and an affinity partitioned target pool accurately predict in vivo Ago binding profiles and miRNA susceptibility to target competition. more...

1570. CpG islands and GC content dictate nucleosome depletion in a transcription independent manner at mammalian promoters (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) One clear hallmark of mammalian promoters is the presence of CpG islands (CGIs) at more than two thirds of genes whereas TATA boxes are only present at a minority of promoters. Using genome-wide approaches, we show that GC content and CGIs are major promoter elements in mammalian cells, able to govern open chromatin conformation and support paused transcription. First, we define three classes of promoters with distinct transcriptional directionality and pausing properties which correlate with their GC content. more...

1572. Gene expression in helped versus helpless CD8 T cells
(Submitter supplied) CD4+ ‘helper’ T cells (TH) are pivotal for the generation and maintenance of CD8+ T cell responses. ‘Helped’ CD8+ T cells receive signals during priming that prevent the induction of the pro-apoptotic molecule TRAIL during reactivation, thereby enabling robust secondary expansion. Conversely, ‘helpless’ CD8+ T cells primed in the absence of TH induce TRAIL expression upon restimulation and undergo activation-induced cell death (AICD). more...

1576. Defining the molecular basis of dendritic cell mediated tolerance
(Submitter supplied)  Using a TCR transgenic transplantation model a series of differently modulated bmDC (IL10, TGFb and VD3 treated, +/-LPS) were established that could mediate tolerance following adaptive transfer.  These modified cells, in contrast to untreated 'immature' bmDC retained their capacity to tolerise following exposure to LPS.  The unmodified, non-tolerogenic, LPS-treated cells provided a comparator population to facilitate investigation into molecular expression patterns that correlate with functional phenotype. more...
