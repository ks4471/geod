19671	gse26927	gpl6255	gse26927	common neuroinflammatory pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.	neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system are characterised by pathogenetic cellular and molecular changes in specific areas of the brain that lead to the dysfunction and_or loss of explicit neuronal populations. despite exhibiting different clinical profiles and selective neuronal loss, common features such as abnormal protein deposition, dysfunctional cellular transport, mitochondrial deficits, glutamate excitotoxicity and inflammation are observed in most, if not all, neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting converging pathways of neurodegeneration. we have generated comparative genome-wide gene expression data for alzheimer_s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, huntington_s disease, multiple sclerosis, parkinson_s disease and schizophrenia using an extensive cohort of well characterised post-mortem cns tissues. the analysis of whole genome expression patterns across these major disorders offers an outstanding opportunity not only to look into exclusive disease specific changes, but more importantly to uncover potential common molecular pathogenic mechanisms that could be targeted for therapeutic gain. surprisingly, no dysregulated gene that passed our selection criteria was found in common across all 6 diseases using our primary method of analysis. however, 61 dysregulated genes were shared when comparing five and four diseases. our analysis indicates firstly the involvement of common neuronal homeostatic, survival and synaptic plasticity pathways. secondly, we report changes to immunoregulatory and immunomodulatory pathways in all diseases. our secondary method of analysis confirmed significant up-regulation of a number of genes in diseases presenting degeneration and showed that somatostatin was downregulated in all 6 diseases. the latter is supportive of a general role for neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis and_or response to neurodegeneration. unravelling the detailed nature of the molecular changes regulating inflammation in the cns is key to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for these chronic conditions.	a total of 113 cases were selected retrospectively on the basis of a confirmed clinical and neuropathological diagnosis and snap-frozen brain blocks were provided by various tissue banks within the brainnet europe network. total rna was extracted from dissected snap-frozen tissue __lt_ 100 mg_ by the individual laboratories according to a bne optimised common protocol using the rneasy_r_ tissue lipid mini kit _qiagen ltd, crawley, uk_ according to the manufacturer_s instructions, and was stored at -80c until further use. gene expression analysis was performed on the rna samples using the illumina whole genome humanref8 v2 beadchip _illumina, london, uk_. all the labelling and hybridisation of the samples was carried out in a single experiment by the imperial college group to reduce the technical variability. rna samples were prepared for array analysis using the illumina totalprep_tm_-96 rna amplification kit _ambion_applied biosystems, warrington, uk_. finally, the beadchips we  re scanned using the illumina beadarray reader. the data was extracted using beadstudio 3.2 _illumina_. data normalisation and gene differential expression analyses were conducted using the rosetta error models available in the rosetta resolver_r_ system _rosetta biosoftware, seattle, wa, usa_. two samples presented very low signal expression most likely due to hybridization problems and did not pass the quality control test. they are not represented here. one of the 2 samples was a replicate, therefore there was loss of only 1 case bringing the grand total of cases used to 112 _total of samples of 118 including 6 replicates_.		expression profiling by array	homo sapiens	22864814,25119539	118

22758	gse29932	gpl11095	gse29932	to identify specific glycosylated structures on brain endothelial cells that mediate rolling, adhesion, and diapedesis of leukocytes in the brain	the blood-brain barrier _bbb_ dynamically controls and maintains a precisely balanced brain microenvironment necessary for reliable functioning. it is made up of highly specialized endothelial cells _ecs_ in the lining of the vascular wall. these ecs are surrounded by the basal lamina, astrocytic perivascular endfeet, pericytes, microglia and neuronal processes that have been shown to contribute to barrier function1. in essence, the brain endothelium limits both transcellular and paracellular passage of cells and molecules into the central nervous system _cns_. transcellular passage of hydrophilic molecules is limited due to a low rate of transcytotic vesicles, an extremely low pinocytotic activity, expression of active efflux transporters, and high metabolic activity. paracellular diffusion of hydrophilic molecules and trafficking of immune cells is restricted by a network of tight junctions _tjs_2-5. due to these characteristics, the bbb is able to protect the cns from sudden changes in blood composition and uncontrolled influx of immune cells. in a large number of neuro-inflammatory diseases, an impaired function and an opening of the bbb are observed. in diseases of the cns like multiple sclerosis or stroke or after brain trauma, the bbb becomes inflamed _mediated by for example reactive oxygen species _ros_ and hypoxia_ and its function severely impaired which gives rise to enhanced cellular infiltration, thus contributing to tissue damage and neurological deficits.   due to the specialized nature of brain ecs, transmigration of leukocytes through cerebrovascular endothelium is likely to differ from that in other vascular beds. generally, the transmigration process is closely controlled by the interaction of leukocytes with the endothelial surface followed by low velocity rolling, arrest, firm adhesion, and finally transmigration. for the diapedesis of immune cells across the cerebral vasculature a re-arrangement of the cytoskeleton and opening of the tj complexes is required to allow cells to pass into the sub endothelial space. in the initial step of the adhesive cascade leukocytes adhere to the endothelium with low affinity. this adhesion is mediated by several members of the selectin family and their corresponding ligands. despite the low affinity of these interactions, resulting contact of leukocytes with the endothelium leads to further activation of both cell types and finally transmigration of the leukocytes through the bbb6,7.	the glycosylation of endothelial cells of different vascular bed origins_br_to date it is unknown which specific carbohydrate structures on the bbb endothelium mediate leukocyte capture and rolling, and whether these structures are differentially expressed onto inflamed brain ec compared to normal brain ecs and vascular beds of other organs. initial studies using qpcr and facs analysis within our group reveal that brain endothelial cells have a different profile in their glycosylation-related genes compared to microvascular ecs upon inflammation, which may result in a different glycosylation profile of adhesive structures and may underlie rolling, adhesion and diapedesis of leukocytes. in this project we wish to identify specific, glycosylated structures on brain endothelial cells that mediate capture, rolling and diapedesis of leukocytes in the brain. to investigate the expression of glycosyltransferases in dendritic cells and the changes in expression associated with maturation. rna preparations from stimulated and non-stimulated hcmec_d3 _human brain endothelial cells line_ and fmvec _human promary microvascular endothelial cells isolated from foreskins_ were sent to both microarray core _e_ and core_c_. the rna was put on an rneasy column, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the glycov3 microarrays. data was sent to dr. van kooyk_s lab for analysis.		expression profiling by array	homo sapiens	unpublished	10
